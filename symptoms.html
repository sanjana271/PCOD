          <h2>symptoms</h2>
          <p>PCOS signs and symptoms usually appear around the time of pubertyâ€™s first menstrual period. PCOS can develop later in life, for example, as a result of significant weight gain. Many women do not realize that they are suffering from PCOD. There are certain common symptoms of PCOD problems:</p>
          <p>
            <br><strong>-Menstruation: </strong>One of the most common signs of PCOD is irregular menstruation. Due to a high amount of male hormones, the body prevents ovulation. Many patients of PCOD have fewer than nine periods a year.
            <br><strong>-Bleeding: </strong>Since the periods are irregular, the buildup of the uterine wall is more. This leads to heavier bleeding whenever the periods happen.
            <br><strong>-Acne: </strong>due to higher amounts of male hormones, the skin secretes more oil causing more acne.
            <br><strong>-Hair Growth: </strong>Most women, who suffer from PCOD, have hair growth on their face, back, stomach and chest. The condition is known as hirsutism.
            <br><strong>-Weight: </strong>Most women who suffer from PCOD are obese or overweight.
            <br><strong>-Crown Baldness: </strong>Most women with PCOD suffer from male pattern baldness with the hair thinning on the crown. Some even suffer complete hair loss.
            <br><strong>-Headaches: </strong>Headaches are triggered by hormonal imbalance.
            <br><strong>-Skin Darkening: </strong>Those who suffer from PCOD observe a darkening of the skin in the groin and the neck region.
            <br><strong>-Increased androgens: </strong>Excessive male sex hormones can present physically as excess face and body hair, as well as male-pattern baldness.</p>
